## Lessons

lessons learnt from each step of the progress

* [out-the-door][1]
    * Just trying to learn as quick as I can. Might not be the best way of doing things. But this gets things done
    * This is quite a shitty structure of mapping the domain model to the different persistent systems through somesort of adapter
      * Everything was done to try to work out excel spreadsheets. And now we're in this great confusion of trying to implement with postgres.
      * Need to rethink this and make it simplier to understand. (TODO!)
