# Piggy Monitor

No we're not monitoring a piglet's growth.

We're monitoring our piggybank!

This will be an educational experiment for me to learn Ruby and at the same time do some household management.



## What's involved

This is a ruby API service using sinatra.


## Starting the endpoint service

On root just type `rackup`

## Run spec test

On root just type `rake test`
