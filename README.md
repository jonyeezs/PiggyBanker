# Piggy Monitor

No we're not monitoring a piglet's growth.

We're monitoring our piggybank!

This will be an educational experiment for me to learn Ruby and at the same time do some household management.



## What's involved

This is a ruby API service using Sinatra the base.


## Starting the endpoint service

Sinatra just sits on top of rack. So why not utilize its simple startup process; thus the use of config.ru.

simple type `rackup`

## Run spec test

Command is `rake test`
